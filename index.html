    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>To acquire a challenging position in a well-established organization, use my extensive skills, knowledge of  Technical and administrative abilities, win the confidence of stakeholder and accomplish an astounding success in my career.</p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3><li>Image Compression using KMeans | Java | Machine Learning</li></h3>
        <p>Used KMeans clustering to compress the image by passing in number of clusters to create using image pixels and calculated the compression. Varied #clusters and iterations to analysed the compression of image as the values change.</p>

        <h3><li>HOME AUTOMATION</li></h3>
        <p>Developed a automation system using an Arduino board with Bluetooth and remotely controlled by an smartphone. By Using The GUI application on mobile phone the loads can be turned ON?OFF remotely, so it becomes smarter.</p>

        <h3><li>HEART DISEASE PREDICTION</li></h3>
        <p>We Work on predicting possible Heart Diseases in people using Machine Learning algorithms. In this project perform the comparative analysis of classifiers like decision tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest.</p>

        <h3><li>Facial Emotion Recognition System | Python | Machine Learning</li></h3>
        <p>Built a facial emotion recognition system based on LDA, using Python data science libraries. The model is built to be insensitive to large variations in the direction of lighting in the training images. Achieved 84% accuracy in recognizing the emotion on the Extended Cohn-Kanade dataset, which has 593 sequences from 123 human subjects.</p>
